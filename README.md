# Discord Economy Bot
A cryptocurrency-styled bot that you can change to your liking.

index.js contains all of the main code. You probably do not need to change anything in here.

user-data.json contains all user data. Don't touch this unless you like to manually adjust balanced.

data.json is there you set up the bot data.

blockchain.json is just the blockchain data. If you want to "disable" this, then erase everything in addToBlockchain() in index.js.

settings.json are bot settings. Put your prefix and bot token here.

# To Use

Open Visual Studio Code or similar.

Open terminal.

Type in "node ." on index.js without quotes.

Enjoy! Make sure it is set up and you have node.js and discord.js.
